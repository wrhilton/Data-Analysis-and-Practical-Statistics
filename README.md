# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks detailing data analysis projects.

## 1. Analyze A/B Test Results

* **File:** `Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb`
* **Description:** This project involves analyzing the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce website. The primary goal is to determine whether the company should implement a new webpage, keep the old one, or continue the experiment for a longer duration. The analysis covers probability, A/B testing methodologies, and regression analysis to interpret the test outcomes.
* **Key Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, random, Matplotlib, Statsmodels.

## 2. Investigate a Dataset - No Show Appointments

* **File:** `Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb`
* **Description:** This project explores a dataset containing information on medical appointments in Brazil, focusing on factors that influence whether a patient shows up for their scheduled appointment. The dataset includes patient demographics (age, gender), appointment details (scheduled day, appointment day, neighborhood), and health information (scholarship status, hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, handicap). The analysis aims to identify key predictors of appointment no-shows.
* **Key Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, csv.
